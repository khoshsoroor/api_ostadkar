# Swagger File and Folder Structure

We implemented new structure for split swagger entities into smaller files according to 
[this blog](https://azimi.me/2015/07/16/split-swagger-into-smaller-files.html) method

# How to Run Script for Merge

- you should have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed.
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run build`

`swagger.yml` file should be created on root of project.
